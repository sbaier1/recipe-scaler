# Recipe scaler

made this really simple recipe scaler app with ChatGPT in about 30minutes just so i can have nice quantity scaling in my notes app that doesn't have a recipe feature.

Just paste your recipe.
Quantities must be specified as number first thing in each line of the recipe.

The tool will encode the recipe in the URL so you can just store the URL and get right back to the previous state.

i have no idea what i'm doing (and neither does ChatGPT) so take everything with a huge grain of salt.
